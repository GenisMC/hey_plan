# Heyplan

## Check notion for current todos.

Heyplan is a project in progress.

The idea of the app is to unite groups of people in a way similar to Tinder dates.

As you go swiping through different **plans** people can create, you have the option to send a join request.
The people who form part of that plan or its admins accept or decline that request.

Plans get created having the user select one or more images, a title, description, initial participants, its visibility and its tags.

The visibility affects whether the plan is shown to everyone with similar interests or only the friend list of the creator.

The tags allow users to find plans closer to their likings. Each user selects some tags they like when creating a profile, and can be changed at any moment.

When some users are inside a same plan, a chat is created between them on the chat section of the my plans page.
